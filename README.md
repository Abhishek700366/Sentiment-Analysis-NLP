**Objective**
2.1) “This report aims to use the NLP techniques including chunking, NER, tokenization, and 
stopwords removal to have the sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset.” 
(KEYWORDS USED: IMDb, NLP, Chunking, NER, Tokenization, Stopwords removal, Sentiment analysis, 
Dataset) 

2.2) “The primary objective of the report is to showcase the impact of comprehensive 
preprocessing towards improving the accuracy and effectiveness of sentiment classification 
models made for analyzing movie reviews. Added to the preprocessing, the report also 
includes EDA, Basic NLTK, Vader Sentimental Analysis” 
(KEYWORDS USED: Preprocessing, Accuracy, Effectiveness, Sentiment classification models, Movie reviews, 
EDA, Basic NLTK, Vader Sentiment Analysis) 

2.3) “The report also seeks to provide insights highlighting the importance of cleaning the 
dataset and preprocessing, while utilizing the machine learning algorithms in the realm of the 
NLP and refining the feature sets for sentiment analysis.” 

(KEYWORDS USED: Cleaning, Preprocessing, Machine learning algorithms, NLP, Feature sets, Sentiment 
analysis) 

2.4) “I submit this report, in hopes of using this preprocessed dataset for further projects, if 
not research pertaining with implications for broader applications in understanding and 
interpreting textual sentiments.”

**About the dataset**

The dataset utilized in the project is on the infamous Internet Movie Database (IMDb), an 
online repository of information related to various sitcoms, movies, series, and even video 
games. According to several critics and customers of their own, IMDb is said to be the 
authoritative and the largest internet platform that supports several user-generated content, 
and reviews from critics and also celebrates an inclusive and diverse perspective on a vast 
array of public and media. 

The dataset extracted that is used in the project, is sourced from Kaggle and consists of quite 
a substantial movie and series reviews, accompanied by a label indicating whether or not the 
reviews by the user are positive or negative. The purpose of my choosing this dataset despite 
the volume of rows in the same is due to its contribution to providing a varied and equal 
collection of textual data and to understand how the data can be trained and the machine 
learning models can be evaluated over the same. 
The dataset is a clear reflection of real-world movie sentiments, however, the names of the 
movies are not included in the dataset, capturing the nuances of an individual’s choice of 
words to communicate their feelings and viewpoints. It is a given that IMDb’s prominence 
and diversity of its user-contributed reviews make the dataset one of a kind and particularly 
advantageous in the field of sentiment analysis
